# UXID_Thinking_Processes
Under my UXID Module, I worked on; low fidelity, high fidelity, user journey mapping, persona storyboard, &amp; usability report.

### 1. Heuristic Review & User Journey Mapping

- **Focus:** Evaluates Audiomack music app using heuristic review & user journey.
  - Intro: Audiomack background (founded 2012, niche: independent artists). Competing with Spotify.

- **User Journey Maps:**
  - Blake: Struggles to find full Marshmello albums → poor navigation & wasted time.

  - Jake: Creating & sharing playlists is tedious; too many clicks, confusing sharing options.

- **Heuristic Evaluation (L.E.M.E.S framework):**

  - Learnability: Pop-up tutorial good ✅, but hidden features & unclear icons ❌.

  - Efficiency: Quick downloads ✅, but poor search & song-finding experience ❌.

  - Memorability: Recently Played helps recall ✅.

  - Error Tolerance: Clear email error messages ✅, but poor song suggestion ❌.

  - Satisfaction: Following artists & commenting pleasant ✅, glitches with ads ❌.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Audiomack is user-friendly but needs improvements: smoother search, better artist-user interaction (e.g. Q&A, live sessions), and fewer glitches.

### 2. Persona, Storyboard & Low-Fi Prototype

- **Focus:** Defines users, scenarios, and low-fi prototype for a music interaction app.

- Personas:
  - Blake: 19, introverted NUS student, uses music for stress relief & connection. Needs interaction with artists & friends.
  - William: 19, Temasek Poly student, listens on-the-go, lacks time to find new music. Needs smarter recommendations.

- Pain Points:
  - Blake: Music apps feel isolating, wants social/interactive features.
  - William: Wastes time trial-and-error searching new songs.

- Storyboard – “Connected Hearts: Empowering Connection and Alleviating Loneliness.”
  - Shows Blake using app features: interacting with artists (live Q&A, VR concerts), chatting with friends, polls for questions.

- Screen Navigation Hierarchy:
  - Home → Tabs: Search, Q&A, Genre, Library, Settings, Virtual Concerts.
  - Features: Recommended music, favorite playlists, live comments, VR events, troubleshooting bot, premium info, messages.

- Low-Fi Prototype: Adobe XD prototype link provided.


### 3. Usability Report & High-Fi Prototype

- **Focus: Usability testing of the prototype.**
  - Test Plan: Defines product goals, objectives, business case, participants, tasks, roles, dates, and equipment.
  - Test Evidence: Slots for 3–5 users with YouTube video recordings of their interactions. 
  - Findings: (Not filled in template, placeholder only).
  - Post-Test Survey: SUS score (to evaluate usability, placeholder).
  - Proposed Solutions: Recommendations based on feedback (to be filled in).
  - High-Fidelity Prototype: Link to preview final UI (to be inserted).
